A collection of various Pine Script indicators to be used on the TradingView Platform.

# How to use

These can be used directly within TradingView as is. That simple, copy & paste.

# How to use in VS Code

Pine Script itself is a user defined language not universally recognized programming or scripting language. Therefore if you wish to use within VS Code I recommend the following:

1. Install the "[Pine Script](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JeylaniB.pinescript)" extension. This will provide the Pine script syntax highlighting.

2. Associate Pine Script files to the "pine" syntax extension installed from above. For this, you must define your own file extension for Pine Script. I recommend \*.tps. Following the below steps:

   1. Go to VS Code settings
   2. Search "File associations"
   3. Click "Add Item"
   4. Add the following:

   - Item = \*.tps
   - Value = pine

Going forward all \*.tps files will automatically be associated to Pine Script. This will make life a easier when working with Pine Scripts files.
